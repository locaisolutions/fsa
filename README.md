# FSharp Static Analysis (FSA)
FSA is a repo that aims to improve the tooling for common static analysis of F#. We currently plan to to support calculating:
- Cyclomatic Complexity 
- Arguments and Bindings / function

and are exploring other metrics that are defined in C# as well.

## Building and Testing
We are leveraging the `dotnet` CLI and attempting to keep our build process as painless as possible. You can always defer to `scripts/build.sh` and `scripts/test.sh` for the exact steps.
